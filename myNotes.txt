react vid 7 poss. loading image not working


Note for office computer which has problems when you add a proxy (to connect the front and backend) to teh frontend package.json:



Setting "allowedHosts" as a property in package.json didn't work for me. I had to wrap it in an options property:

"options": {
    "allowedHosts": ["localhost", ".localhost"],
    "proxy": "https://localhost:3386/"
  }
After that, npm start did the trick without having to re-install modules.

REMOVE THE OPTIONS OBJECT WITH ALLOWEDHOSTS AND PROXY FROM THE FRONTEND PACKAGE.JSON IF IT DOESN'T WORK ON HOME COMPUTER
